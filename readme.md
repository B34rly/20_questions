# 20 Questions
This is a small Python/Gtk3 game that asks you questions to find your chosen fruit/animal. 

It automatically asks questions based on the most polarizing features - the database can be updated to include as many items as possible and the program scales 

Built using PyInstaller into a cross-platform executable.

Created as a class assignment (got 20/20 B) i'm so cool)

<sub><sub>(yes ik python is a bad idea for applications but I had to get it done quick and easy and my alternative (gtk/rust) was unpreferrable)
